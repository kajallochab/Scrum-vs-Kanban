# Scrum-vs-Kanban
Comparative analysis for most suited approach for Software Development

This repository contains the LaTeX source files for a paper comparing Scrum and Kanban methodologies in software development.

## Getting Started

To compile the LaTeX files and generate the PDF document, you will need a LaTeX compiler installed on your system. Here are some popular options:

- Overleaf: A free online LaTeX editor and compiler (https://www.overleaf.com/)
- TeX Live: A comprehensive TeX distribution for various operating systems (https://www.tug.org/texlive/portable.html)
-  MikTeX: A widespread TeX distribution for Windows (https://miktex.org/)

Once you have a LaTeX compiler installed, you can navigate to the directory containing the source files and compile the document using the appropriate command for your chosen compiler.

For example, if you are using pdflatex, you would run the following command in your terminal:

```
pdflatex main.tex
```

This will generate a file named `main.pdf`, which contains the final formatted document.

## Dependencies

This document relies on the following LaTeX packages:

- graphicx: for including images
- caption: for adding captions to tables and figures
- tabularx: for creating tables with flexible column widths
- hyperref: for adding hyperlinks (optional)
- ieeetr: bibliography style for IEEE referencing (you may need to install this package separately)

Ensure these packages are installed on your system so the document can be compiled successfully.
